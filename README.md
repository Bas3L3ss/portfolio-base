PROBLEM TO ADDRESS:
1/ app folder: make it a app folder like you wanted, each project is
2/ better stylings:

- background image
- put number in the battery, 60 is yellow, 20 is red
- add actual app images
- put snake game at front
- upon opening app the screen is swelling at the app icon position
- add more things to my page, fix the app layout ( footer )
- change the layout as much as like chtawng, having searchable bar at the bottom ( shacn ui command )
  - projects, research, experiences, testimonials are at top left
  - Spotify chill at top right
  - weather bar
  - bottom left locket ( my pic, saying hi )
  - bottom right having about-me, cta, tech skills, snake game
    => try to mimic as much as you can
